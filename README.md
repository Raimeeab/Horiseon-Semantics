### Project Description:
The goal of the assignment was to refract the code to ensure: 
- all links are functional
- CSS selectors and properties are consolidated and organised to follow semantic structure
- CSS file is properly commented 

## Technologies used:
- Updated all <div> elements to appropriate semantic in the html file
- Fixed broken link on line 35 
- Changed all CSS classes with the same properties to one class 
- Added CSS file comments and grouped them in order of appearance on the HTML file for easier viewing
